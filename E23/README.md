# Episode 23: APIs and their Gateways

## Description

What's an API Gateway? Do I need one? From gateways like 3scale to conferences like GlueCon, APIs seem to be all the thing. However, what does this even mean? Like, an API is "just" an Application Programming Interface, why all the buzz? Join us to demystify the API-buzz which, while technically accurate, is really a euphemism for services.

### Show Recap

We led off with some announcements.
In particular, a couple of upcoming conferences you might be interested in.
[DevConf.CZ](https://devconf.cz) is on the 18th of Feb.
[KubeCon EU](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) also just opened its super early bird tickets for $10.
We also highlighted a few upcoming guests, Dan Walsh, Chris Wright, and Brent Baude.
So, watch the [Calendar](https://red.ht/streamcal) for updates.

We finally move on to talk about API Management/API Gateways.
Specifically, a conversation about the overlap of the term "Service Mesh" from 15-20 years ago which provided for the management of services.
We discuss the history of [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and the transition to microservices.
We also talk about how the old "Service Mesh" concept is now the concept (largely) of API management and "Service Mesh" means something else (see [Episode 21](../E21/README.md) for more).

We walk through the Wikipedia definition of [API Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_management).

We move on to discuss prolific APIs in the wild.
Using [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com/home), [Zapier](https://zapier.com), and [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/) as examples.
We even mention a conference *about* APIs: [GlueCon](http://gluecon.com/).

We eventually get to the crux of the point.
"APIs" and "ABIs" are really just "services."
We also mention [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) as a "counter example" for a "service is a service" even if there are humans in the mix.

We move on to the [Sweet, Sweet Internet Points](#sweet-sweet-internet-points).

We attempt to run a [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) game.
However, that goes poorly :(.
We will try a definite technology for the next episode.
Nothing against Kahoot, but the delay introduced in live streaming does not mesh well.

Finally, we answer some questions from the chat.
